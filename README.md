# GitDotNetClone

**GitDotNetClone** is a minimal version-control system written in C#, inspired by the internal architecture of Git. This project aims to demystify Git's core mechanisms like hashing, object storage, staging, and commits â€” implemented from scratch using idiomatic .NET code.

## ðŸš€ Features (In Progress)

- [ ] `init` â€“ Initialize a new repository (`.git` directory)
- [ ] `add` â€“ Track changes to files by hashing and storing them
- [ ] `commit` â€“ Save a snapshot of the staged changes
- [ ] `status` â€“ Show current repository state
- [ ] `log` â€“ View commit history
